your commit access

**Commit Guidelines**

First, your submissions should not contain any whitespace errors. (use git diff --check)

Next, try to make each commit a logically separate changeset. 

The last thing to keep in mind is the commit message.

**Private Small Team**

The basic format is `<oldref>..<newref> fromref → toref`, where `oldref` means the old reference, `newref` means the new reference, `fromref` is the name of the local reference being pushed, and `toref` is the name of the remote reference being updated.
